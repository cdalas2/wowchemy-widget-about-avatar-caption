## ðŸŒˆ Add the Widget to your Site

1. Install the widget by referencing it in your `config/_defaults/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   module:
     imports:
       - path: github.com/cdalas2/wowchemy-widget-about-avatar-caption
   ```
   
2. Create an instance of your widget in `content/home/`, for example let's create `content/home/github.about-avatar-caption.md`
   ```markdown
---
# An instance of the About Avatar Caption widget.
# Documentation: https://wowchemy.com/docs/page-builder/
widget: github.cdalas2.about-avatar-caption

# Activate this widget? true/false
active: true

# This file represents a page section.
headless: true

# Order that this section appears on the page.
weight: 1
  
author: admin
---
  ```

3. Create an instance of an author profile in `content/authors/`, for example let's create `content/authors/admin/_index.md`
  ```markdown
---
# Display name

superuser: true
